# 🍺 Brewery BI — End-to-End Analytics Engineering Project

**Python (AI-assisted) • SQL • DuckDB • Power BI**

---

## 📌 Overview

Brewery BI is an end-to-end analytics engineering project simulating a realistic BI environment for a fictional brewery.

The project demonstrates practical, production-oriented skills across:

- Data engineering
- Analytics engineering
- BI modeling
- KPI design and DAX logic

It covers the full lifecycle of data:

**Synthetic data generation → SQL transformations → Analytical modeling → Semantic layer → Executive dashboards**

The goal is to present a clean, reproducible example of a modern BI workflow built with lightweight, scalable tools.

**Layer Responsibilities**

- **generator/**: Python-based synthetic data generator with AI-assisted logic  
- **database/**: DuckDB analytical database serving as the transformation engine  
- **generator/sql/**: SQL logic for building dimensions and analytical marts  
- **power_bi/**: Semantic model and dashboard implementation  
- **screenshots/**: Portfolio visuals of final dashboards

## 🧪 Data Generation (Python + AI)

Synthetic operational data is generated using Python scripts enhanced with AI-assisted behavioral modeling.

The generator simulates realistic brewery operations across:

- Sales
- Production
- Logistics
- Quality
- Customers
- Products (beer types)
- Plants and regions

The dataset includes:

- Seasonality patterns
- Production variability
- Downtime events
- Waste and defect behavior
- Margin fluctuations
- Inventory dynamics

The objective is to produce data that behaves like real operational systems rather than random mock data.

## 🛠 SQL Transformations & Modeling

All transformations are executed in DuckDB using SQL.

The project follows a layered modeling approach:

- Date dimension creation  
- Standardized Silver-layer tables  
- Gold-layer analytical models  
- Monthly KPI marts  

Business logic implemented in SQL includes:

- Revenue and gross margin calculations  
- Production volume metrics  
- OEE computation  
- Waste and defect rate  
- Inventory coverage (days)  
- YoY, MoM, and rolling metrics  

The structure mirrors modern analytics engineering practices used in production BI systems.

## ⚡ DuckDB as Analytical Engine

DuckDB acts as the central transformation engine.

**Why DuckDB:**

- High-performance columnar execution  
- Lightweight and file-based  
- No server setup required  
- Seamless integration with Power BI  
- Ideal for analytics prototyping  

It provides a practical example of local-first analytics architecture.

## 📊 Power BI Semantic Model & Dashboards

The Power BI report is built on a star-schema semantic model.

**Dashboard Pages:**

- **Executive Overview**: Revenue, Margin, Volume, Inventory Coverage KPIs  
- **Sales & Market**: Performance by region, customer, channel, and time  
- **Production & Quality**: OEE, downtime, waste, defect rate  
- **Logistics**: Stock levels, inventory coverage, daily sales trends  
- **Beer Performance (Drill-through)**: Product-level analysis with dynamic filtering  

**🧮 DAX Highlights:**

- Time intelligence (YoY, MoM, YTD)  
- Rolling window calculations  
- KPI delta logic using VAR patterns  
- Conditional formatting measures  
- Dynamic drill-through context handling  
- Clean star-schema optimization  

The model separates business logic from visuals and follows performance-oriented DAX patterns.
